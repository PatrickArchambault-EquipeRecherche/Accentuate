# Accentuate
Converting and harmonizing CSV files with accents

## Purpose
It is easy to have CSV (Comma Separated Values) files with *special* characters, but not always easy to read them, or move their data from place to place without losing data due to these characters.  Sometimes, the results are subtle, and you won't know that you lost anything until much later.

*Special* characters may be accents, but they also include punctuation, such as "curly" apostrophes and quote marks.  It is easy to get text data with incompatible characters from one field to another, but hard to reconcile manually.

This program aims to streamline CSV files into a single character set, in spite of any characters within them.
